The higher-doped DIAC profile exhibits earlier breakdown and higher current, caused by narrower depletion regions and stronger electric-field buildup under forward bias.

Enhanced doping increases carrier concentration and impact ionization, leading to a lower effective breakover voltage and higher post-breakdown conduction.

The lower-doped DIAC profile maintains low current over a wider voltage range, as wider depletion regions delay electric-field intensification and breakdown.

Breakdown in the lower-doped structure occurs at a higher applied voltage with reduced current magnitude due to limited carrier availability.

Forward- and reverse-bias characteristics remain symmetric, confirming proper DIAC operation, with reverse bias showing identical behavior of opposite polarity.
