The space-charge profile shows a smooth, monotonic variation across the device, indicating a wider and more uniformly distributed depletion region compared to the UM case.

The electric field (X-direction) decreases gradually across the active region, suggesting reduced peak field concentration and a more distributed voltage drop.

The electric field (Y-direction) exhibits a localized peak near the junction, arising from vertical field components due to geometry and doping gradients.

Electron density increases steadily along the device length, reflecting enhanced carrier injection and transport under forward bias for the NM profile.

Electron and hole mobility show mild spatial variation, primarily influenced by local electric field strength rather than abrupt doping-induced scattering.

The band diagram indicates smoother band bending with quasi-Fermi levels separating gradually, consistent with lower field crowding and delayed onset of strong carrier multiplication.

Overall, the NM doping profile leads to a more gradual field build-up and softer turn-on behavior, which is expected to increase breakdown voltage compared to the UM case.
