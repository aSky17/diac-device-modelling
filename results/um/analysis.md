The electrostatic potential distribution in the micrometer-scale DIAC shows a gradual potential drop across extended depletion regions, indicating that the applied bias is distributed over a relatively large device length.

The space-charge profile reveals wide and well-defined depletion regions at the junctions, consistent with moderate electric-field buildup typical of micrometer-scale structures.

Electric-field components peak near the junction interfaces but remain lower in magnitude and more spatially spread compared to scaled devices, resulting in delayed breakdown.

Electron and hole mobility remain largely uniform across the bulk regions, with only minor degradation near the high-field junctions due to reduced field intensity.

Carrier density variations indicate controlled carrier injection near the junctions, while the band diagram shows smooth band bending and gradual quasi-Fermi level separation, confirming stable blocking behavior prior to breakdown.

Inference: The micrometer-scale DIAC exhibits stable blocking with wide depletion regions and moderate electric-field concentration, leading to higher breakover voltage and smoother transition into conduction compared to scaled implementations.
